    <h2>Hi, my name is Vicky.</h2>
    <img src="./static/vickyimg.png" alt="">
    <p id = "intro">I am an undergraduate student at CMU, studying physics and music tech.
        In my free time, I like to make music, draw, crochet, model, and play softball.
        If you listen to my music, you will hear an assortment of melancholic, reflective melodies,
        but I'm also incorporating more jazz elements in my style as well.
        I'd say that the music I make reflects my personality pretty accurately - I am deeply reflective,
        nostalgic, and like to romanticize life. Lastly, I am a curious person and
        will approach random strangers to talk, despite being introverted.</p>
    <p>Let's connect (emotionally)!</p>
